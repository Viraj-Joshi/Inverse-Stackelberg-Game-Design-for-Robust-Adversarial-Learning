# Inverse-Stackelberg-Game-Design-for-Robust-Adversarial-Learning

This is a slight twist on https://cvc-lab.github.io/cvc-website/projects/adversarial-cloaking/ where an adversarial patch is trained in a GAN like setup where a generator applies a 3d patch and a learner (YOLOv6) attempts to discriminate.
